# What We're Covering on Day 27 â€“ APIs in Python:
Making HTTP Requests:
We're using the requests library to send a GET request to a public API (NewsAPI) and retrieve data from the internet.

Working with JSON Data:
The response from the API is in JSON format, and we convert it to a Python dictionary using .json() for easy access.

Looping Through API Responses:
We loop through the list of articles and print useful information like the title and description for each one.
